## [Project 4 : Comparative study of countries(Data Visualization)](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Comparative-study-of-countries-Tableau)
* Created a dashboard to do a comparative study on various parameters of different countries using the sample insurance dataset and world development indicators dataset.
* Colored the map based on Income column from the secondary dataset.
* Included a filter of income group to the dashboard and a webpage to show data from world bank webpage driven by an URL action from geography graph.
* Created a KPI Table to show the comparison between the selected period and the prior period to the selected one.
* Categorized parameter to have Life Insurance Share, Market Share, Penetration, Ratio of Reinsurance Accepted & Retention Ratio.
* Created a calculated field to calculate the growth % and a table to show these values as shown.
* Title updation based on the category selection.
* Displayed growth indicator to display Negative, No Change and Positive as values and corresponding shapes against it.
* Dashboard filter for income group applied for all charts with the filter action enabled in the map as well.

## [Project 5 : Healthcare Diabetes Prediction : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/HealthCare_Diabetes)
* Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. 
* EDA
* Classification model like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier,
Gradient Boosting Classifier, KNN Classifier are considered.
* Model evaluation for classification type is done by using confusion matrix, accuracy score.
* Modeling using Deep learning tensorflow using keras.

## [Project 6 : Customer Service Requests Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Customer-Service-Requests-Analysis)
* Performed a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. 
* Focused on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types.
* Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing.
* Provided major insights/patterns in a visual format (graphs or tables) and 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.
* Ordered the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
* Performed a statistical test to state Null and Alternate and provided a statistical test to accept or reject the Null hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘pvalue’


## [Project 7 : Taxi-Trajectory-Prediction : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Taxi-Trajectory-Prediction)
## Overview:
* Built a predictive framework that is able to infer the final destination of taxi rides.
* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)- finding outliers, Feature Analysis
* Feature Engineering- Encoding, Feature importance
* Model Selection & Evaluation
* Prediction for provided test dataset.
