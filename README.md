# [Project 1 : Customer Service Requests Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Customer-Service-Requests-Analysis)
* Performed a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. 
* Focused on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types.
* Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing.
* Provided major insights/patterns in a visual format (graphs or tables) and 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.
* Ordered the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
* Performed a statistical test to state Null and Alternate and provided a statistical test to accept or reject the Null hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘pvalue’

# [Project 2 : Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing)
* Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.
* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)- finding outliers, Feature Analysis
* Feature Engineering- Encoding, Feature importance,Factor Analysis, Scaling,
* Model Selection & Evaluation - 3 ML models used Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor & XGBoost.

# [Project 3 : Lending Club Loan Data Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/syedsabeel88/Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis)
* Create a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
* Feature Engineering- One Hot Encoding
* Performed oversampling technique using SMOTE on imbalanced dataset.
* Building & training Deep learning model.
