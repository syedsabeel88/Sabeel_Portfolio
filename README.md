# Project 1 : Customer Service Requests Analysis : Project Overview
* Performed a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. 
* Focused on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types.
* Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing.
* Provided major insights/patterns in a visual format (graphs or tables) and 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.
* Ordered the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
* Performed a statistical test to state Null and Alternate and provided a statistical test to accept or reject the Null hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘pvalue’
